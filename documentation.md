## Diffraction Elastic Constants

You will be able to select diffraction elastic constants (DECs) for the stress calculation from a list of published values. This is a non-exhaustive list and we cannot guarantee that all published values are included. However, we try to update this table on a regular basis. If you find missing data or know of a publication that highlights DECs that are of interest to you, please contact us or submit an issue.
